## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 0.0.5.1) for the latest minor version.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Keep Software Updated**: Always use the latest version of Nidec CommanderCDE
2. **Secure Connections**: Ensure all connections to Nidec drives are made over secure channels
3. **Access Control**: Restrict access to the application and connected drives to authorized personnel only
4. **Logging**: Monitor application logs for any suspicious activities

## Known Security Considerations

- The application communicates with Nidec drives using serial communication
- No authentication is required to connect to a drive, so physical access control is important
- All sensitive operations should be logged
